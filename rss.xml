 <title>Migration to GitHub is complete</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/140.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>After several years of using GitHub specifically for its pull request system,
the Coq development team has migrated the
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/issues">Coq bug tracker</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki">Cocorico, the Coq wiki</a>
to GitHub as well.</p>

<p>More information about the migration of the Coq bug tracker may be found in this
<a href="https://www.theozimmermann.net/2017/10/bugzilla-to-github/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>More information about the migration of Cocorico, the Coq wiki, may be found on this
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/WikiMigration">wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the GitHub repository is now the repository we push to
(as opposed to a mirror). Make sure that your git clone is tracking
<a href="https://github.com/coq/coq">https://github.com/coq/coq.git</a>
to be always up-to-date.</p>

 <description><![CDATA[
The <a href="/coq-87">final release of Coq 8.7.0</a> is available.

Coq 8.7 includes:

<ul>
  <li>A large amount of work on cleaning and speeding up the code base, notably
    the work of Pierre-Marie Pédrot on making the tactic-level system
    insensitive to existential variable expansion, providing a safer API to
    plugin writers and making the code more robust.</li>
  <li>New tactics:
    <ul>
      <li>Variants of tactics supporting existential variables <tt>eassert</tt>,
        <tt>eenough</tt>, etc. by Hugo Herbelin;</li>
      <li>Tactics <tt>extensionality in H</tt> and <tt>inversion_sigma</tt> by
        Jason Gross;</li>
      <li><tt>specialize with</tt> accepting partial bindings by Pierre
        Courtieu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cumulative Polymorphic Inductive Types, allowing cumulativity of
    universes to go through applied inductive types, by Amin Timany and
    Matthieu Sozeau.</li>
  <li>The SSReflect plugin by Georges Gonthier, Assia Mahboubi and Enrico Tassi
    was integrated (with its documentation in the reference manual) by Maxime
    Dénès, Assia Mahboubi and Enrico Tassi.</li>
  <li>The <tt>coq_makefile</tt> tool was completely redesigned to improve its
    maintainability and the extensibility of generated Makefiles, and to make
    <tt>_CoqProject</tt> files more palatable to IDEs by Enrico Tassi.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information can be found in the <a
href="https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/V8.7.0/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file. Feedback and
<a href="/bugs">bug reports</a> are extremely welcome.</p>

<p>This is the second release of Coq developed on a time-based development
  cycle. Its development spanned 9 months from the release of Coq 8.6 and was
  based on a public road-map. It attracted many external contributions. Code
  reviews and continuous integration testing were systematically used before
  integration of new features, with an important focus given to compatibility
  and performance issues.</p>

 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/coq-received-acm-sigplan-programming-languages-software-2013-award.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>The development of Coq has been initiated in 1984 at INRIA by Thierry Coquand and Gérard Huet, then joined by Christine Paulin-Mohring and more than 40 direct <a href="/who-did-what-in-coq">contributors</a>.</p>
<p>The first public release was CoC 4.10 in 1989. Extended with native inductive types, it was renamed Coq in 1991.</p>
<p>Since then, a growing community of users has shared its enthousiasm in the originality of the concepts of Coq and of its various features, as a richly-typed programming language and as an interactive theorem prover.</p>

 <title>Coq 8.3 is out !</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/coq-83-is-out.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>We are pleased to announce the final release of <a href="/download">Coq 8.3</a> which includes a new tactic (<code>nsatz</code>, standing for Hilbert's NullStellensatz, that extends <code>ring</code> to systems of polynomial equations) and a few new libraries (a certification of mergesort, a new library of finite sets with computational and logical contents separated).</p>
<p>This version also comes with many improvements of existing features, especially regarding the tactics, the module system, extraction, the type classes, the program command, libraries, coqdoc. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<ul>
<li>new operator <code>&lt;+</code> for conveniently chaining application of functors</li>
<li>new round of extension of the modular library of arithmetic</li>
<li>support for matching terms with binders in Ltac,</li>
<li>linking notations in coqdoc,</li>
<li>quote tactic now working on arbitrary expressions,</li>
<li><code>Lemma</code> and co accept parameters that are automatically introduced,</li>
<li>interactive proofs in module types,</li>
<li>a beautifying coqc option for pretty-printing files</li>
</ul>
<p>See the file <a href="/distrib/V8.3/CHANGES">CHANGES</a> for a full log of changes.</p>
<p>Even if we try to preserve compatibility as much as possible with Coq 8.2, we had to arbitrate for a break of behavior in some situations. The major incompatibilities can be easily treated by using the new <code>-compat 8.2</code> option or by setting/unsetting adequate options. See <a href="/distrib/V8.3/COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a> for details and migration recommendations.</p>
<p>In addition to the "ssreflect" plugin, extension packages we are aware about include the following (but probably there are more):</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>Heq</code> library for smooth rewriting using heterogeneous equality by C.-K. Hur;</li>
<li>the <code>aac_tactics</code> plugin for rewriting modulo associativity and commutativity by T. Braibant and D. Pous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also the following user contributions submitted since 8.2 was released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projective geometry in plane and space (N. Magaud, J. Narboux, P. Schreck)</li>
<li>Proofs of Quicksort's worst- and average-case complexity (Eelis)</li>
<li>Tactic that helps to prove inductive lemmas by fixpoint "descente infinie" functions (M. Li)</li>
<li>A tactic for deciding Kleene algebras (T. Braibant and D. Pous)</li>
</ul>

 <title>Announcing Ssreflect version 1.2</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/announcing-ssreflect-version-12.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>The Mathematical Components Team, at the Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Center released a new version of Ssreflect, an powerful extension for Coq. For more information, read the official announcement:</p>
<p>«<br />
We are pleased to announce the new release of the Ssreflect<br />
extension library for the Coq proof assistant, version<br />
8.2/8.2pl1. This release includes:<br />
- an update of the tactic language which complies with the new version<br />
  of Coq;<br />
- an update of the combinatoric libraries distributed in the previous<br />
  release of ssreflect;<br />
- a new set of libraries for abstract algebra.</p>
<p>The name Ssreflect stands for "small scale reflection", a style of<br />
proof that evolved from the computer-checked proof of the Four Colour<br />
Theorem and which leverages the higher-order nature of Coq's<br />
underlying logic to provide effective automation for many small,<br />
clerical proof steps. This is often accomplished by restating<br />
("reflecting") problems in a more concrete form, hence the name. For<br />
example, in the Ssreflect library arithmetic comparison is not an<br />
abstract predicate, but a function computing a boolean.</p>
<p>Along with documentation, also available at<br />
<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384" title="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384">https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384</a> the Ssreflect distribution<br />
comprises two parts:<br />
- A new tactic language, which promotes more structured, concise and<br />
  robust proof scripts, and is in fact independent from the "reflection"<br />
  proof style. It is implemented as a linkable extension to the Coq<br />
  system.<br />
- A set of Coq libraries that provide core "reflection-oriented"<br />
  theories for<br />
  + basic combinatorics: arithmetic, lists, graphs, and finite sets.<br />
  + abstract algebra: an algebraic hierarchy from<br />
    additive groups to closed fields, polynomials, matrix,<br />
    basic finite group theory, infrastructure for finite summations,...)</p>
<p>Some features of the tactic language:<br />
- It provides tacticals for most structural steps (e.g., moving<br />
  assumptions), so that script steps mostly match logical steps.<br />
- It provides tactics and tatical to support structured layout,<br />
  including reordering subgoals and supporting "without loss of<br />
  generality" arguments.<br />
- It provides a powerful rewriting tactic that supports chained<br />
  rules, automatic unfolding of definitions and conditional rewriting,<br />
  as well as precise control over where and how much rewriting occurs.<br />
- It can be used in combination with the classic Coq tactic language.</p>
<p>Some features of the library:<br />
- Exploits advanced features of Coq such as coercions and canonical<br />
  projections to build generic theories (e.g., for decidable equality).<br />
- Uses rewrite rules and dependent predicate families to state<br />
  lemmas that can be applied deeply and bidirectionally. This means<br />
  fewer structural steps and a smaller library, respectively.<br />
- Uses boolean functions to represent sets (i.e., comprehensions),<br />
  rather than an ad hoc set algebra.</p>
<p>The Ssreflect 1.2 distribution is available at<br />
   <a href="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/" title="http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/">http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/projects/mathematical-components-2/</a><br />
It is distributed under either one (your choice) of the CeCILL-B or CeCILL<br />
version 2 licences (the French equivalent of the BSD and GNU GPL licenses,<br />
respectively).</p>
<p>The tactic language is quite stable; we have been using it<br />
internally for three years essentially without change. We will support<br />
new releases of Coq in due course. We also plan to extend the core<br />
library as our more advanced work on general and linear algebra<br />
progresses.</p>
<p>Comments and bug reports are of course most welcome, and can be<br />
directed at ssreflect(at-sign)msr-inria.inria.fr. To subscribe, either<br />

 <title>A tactic for deciding Kleene algebras</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/a-tactic-for-deciding-kleene-algebras.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>Thomas Braibant and Damien Pous are pleased to announce the first release of ATBR, a Coq library whose aim is to provide tools for working with various algebraic structures, including non-commutative idempotent semirings and Kleene algebras.</p>
<p>The main tactic they provide in this library is a reflexive tactic for solving (in)equations in Kleene algebras. The decision procedure goes through standard finite automata constructions, that they formalized.</p>
<p>For example, this tactic automatically solves goals of the form <code>a#*(b+a#*(1+c))# == (a+b+c)# or a*b*c*a*b*c*a# &lt;= a#*(b*c+a)#</code>, where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are elements of an arbitrary Kleene algebra (binary relations, regular languages, min-max expressions...), <code>#</code> is the (postfix) star operation, <code>*</code> is the infix product or concatenation operation, <code>+</code> is the sum or union operation, and <code>1</code> is the neutral element for <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>In order to define this tactic, they had to work with matrices, so that the ATBR library also contains a new formalisation of matrices in Coq along with a set of tools (notably, "ring"-like tactic for matrices whose dimensions are not necessarily uniform).</p>
<p>More details can be found from <a href="https://github.com/coq-contribs/atbr"> Coq user contribution web-page</a></p>
<p>In particular, a Coq file illustrating the kind of tools we provide can be found <a href="https://github.com/coq-contribs/atbr/blob/master/Examples.v">there</a>.</p>

 <title>A locally-nameless backend for Ott</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/a-locally-nameless-backend-for-ott.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">Ott</a> tool, 
developed by  Peter Sewell and Francesco Zappa Nardelli,
has recently been extended to compile language definitions
to a Coq representation in locally-nameless style with cofinite 
quantification, as popularised in Engineering Formal Metatheory by
Aydemir, Charguéraud, Pierce, Pollack and Weirich. It deals with the
single-binder case only.</p>
<p>Some examples (including STLC, Fsub, and the nu-calculus of Pitts and
Stark) and the documentation are available from the <a 
href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/projects/ln_ott/">ln-ott page</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">project web-site</a>.</p>
<p>This is related to the recent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100716005113/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~baydemir/papers/lngen/">LNgen</a> tool of Brian Aydemir and Stephanie Weirich.</p>

 <title>Announcing LNgen</title>
 <link>https://coq.inria.fr/news/announcing-lngen.html</link>
 <description><![CDATA[
<p>Stephanie Weirich and Brian Aydemir are pleased to announce 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100716005113/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~baydemir/papers/lngen/">LNgen</a>, 
a prototype tool for generating Coq code for the infrastructure associated with a
locally nameless representation. This work builds upon their work with
Charguéraud, Pierce, and Pollack on Engineering Formal Metatheory,
where they described a locally nameless strategy for representing
languages with binding.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100716005113/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~baydemir/papers/lngen/">LNgen</a> uses a subset of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/">Ott specification language</a> as its input
language. Currently, it supports the definition of syntax with single
binders. Compared to the recently announced <a 
href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/projects/ln_ott/">locally nameless backend
for Ott</a>, LNgen does not handle the definition of relations, but it
does generate a large collection of "infrastructure" lemmas and their
proofs, e.g., facts about substitution.</p>

 <title>Announcing Ssreflect 1.1</title>

 <description><![CDATA[
<p>The Microsoft Research-Inria Joint Center is pleased to announce<br />
the first full release of the Ssreflect extension library for the Coq<br />
proof assistant, version 8.1.</p>
<p>The name Ssreflect stands for "small scale reflection", a style of<br />

abstract predicate, but a function computing a boolean.</p>
