The discussion was mainly about wishes:

Question: Can we have stronger automatically-generated induction principles
(e.g. for trees made from lists of trees)?

Answer: This has not been implemented because there
is no canonical way to define such induction principles.

Question: Can we reopen a module after it has been closed to extend it?

Answer: This does not seem to present some intrinsic difficulties.

Question: Is it possible to combine coinductive and inductive types?

Answer: The current state of knowledge is that in the general case,
this leads to paradoxes.

Question: Could it be possible to document in the extracted source
file the propositional parts that have been removed?

Answer: This does not seem to be difficult.

Question: How safe is extraction? Can we claim that extracted
certified programs are trustable?

Answer: As far as we assume that the extraction module is not bugged,
the extracted programs are safe under the assumption that they are
applied to arguments that satisfy the preconditions of the
specification of the program.
